ðŸ”¹ What is a Buffer in Node.js?

A Buffer is like a temporary storage box that holds raw binary data (0s and 1s) directly in memory.
Think of it as a fixed-size array of bytes.

In your example:

const buff1 = Buffer.from("Hello Bago");


"Hello Bago" â†’ text string (UTF-8 encoded).

Buffer.from() â†’ converts it into raw bytes.

Output:

<Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 42 61 67 6f>


Here:

48 = ASCII code for H

65 = ASCII code for e

â€¦ and so on.

So a buffer is binary representation of data in memory.

âœ… Buffers are useful when:

Reading data from files

Receiving data from network

Handling images, zips, or other binary formats

ðŸ”¹ What is a Stream?

A Stream is a sequence of data chunks flowing over time, built on top of Buffers.

Imagine:

Buffer = a bucket holding water

Stream = water flowing through a pipe

Node.js Streams work with chunks of Buffers instead of loading everything at once.
Thatâ€™s why they are memory-efficient for large files.

Example:

const fs = require("fs");

const rs = fs.createReadStream("bigfile.txt");
rs.on("data", chunk => {
    console.log("New chunk received:", chunk);
});


Here:

Each chunk is a Buffer.

You donâ€™t wait for the whole file â†’ you process it piece by piece.

A chunk is not a group of Buffers.

A chunk is one Buffer, which may contain multiple characters/bytes depending on the encoding.
